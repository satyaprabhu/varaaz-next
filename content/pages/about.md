> "My teaching approach demonstrates how geometric patterns influence human physiology and psychology, creating balance between mind, body, and spirit."

## The Science Behind Sacred Geometry

*"Sacred geometry charts the unfolding of number in space"* — Nassim Haramein, Quantum Physicist

### Neuroscience & Art Therapy

**NIH Study (2023)**: Systematic review of 11 studies showed mandala art improves psychological well-being:

- Reduces anxiety & stress by 25-30%
- Promotes alpha brain wave states associated with relaxation
- Improves sustained focus by 40% after sessions
- Supports emotional regulation through creative expression

### Nature's Code

Sacred geometry patterns appear throughout nature at every scale:

- **Flower of Life** contains all five Platonic solids — the building blocks of matter
- **Fibonacci Spiral** appears in DNA structure, galaxy formation, and plant growth
- **Torus Field** shapes energy flow in atoms, hearts, and planetary fields
- **Golden Ratio (1.618)** governs proportions in human faces, art, and architecture

When we create these forms in art, we align with the same patterns that govern universal creation.
